## City of Calgary Building Permit
ENGO 651 - Adv. Topics on Geospatial Technologies - Projects 3


Description
In project 3, we implemented a simple web app for users to view building permits issued by the City of Calgary.
in Project 4 we integrated a vector tileset to an existing GeoWeb application by mashing up a styled vector tileset hosted on Mapbox. users can be able to toggle between the mapbox to search for a building permit or view the traffic incident data set.

At the top of the page, we use a widget from [daterangepicker](https://www.daterangepicker.com/).com to allow the user to select start and end dates and view up to 1000 building permits issued within that date range. The results are displayed as markers on the main [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) map. When a marker is clicked, a popup displays additional information about the particular building permit. To ensure the map doesn't get too crowded with markers, we utilize the Marker [Cluster](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster) plugin to group nearby markers into clusters which dynamically update when they are clicked or when the user zooms on the map. This plugin also allows us to spiderfy markers which have the same location so that they can be differentiated. The markers can be cleared from the map using the "clear" button.


### File descriptions

The file index.html defines the content composing the frontend of our application and links to the required libraries and plugins. All styling is contained in the style.css file.

The file script.js contains the backend logic of the application. In this file, we instantiate a Leaflet map. jQuery is used to define the properties and functionality the date picker widget. Once a date range is selected, we retreive building permit data from the Open Calgary API and display the returned information using markers and popups on the map.
